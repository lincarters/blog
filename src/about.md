- I enjoy writing, but when I do, I don't feel that I'm particularly good at it.
- I don't often take [photos](photography), but when I do, I quite enjoy it.

I surround myself with positive thinking and try my best to be free from negative emotions. I try to see see things in a positive light. I think perspective is important and something that you can forge.
