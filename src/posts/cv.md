## Hobbies & Interests
### I enjoy building websites.
I primarily write plain CSS and HTML. I started at a young age and it's a hobby I keep returning to. Now, I am developing my personal website built on 11ty.

I often read content design related articles. The "front of the front-end" intrigues me; the intersection between development, content design and usability. I have a weakness for eye-pleasing typography.
