Hey, you're on my <dfn title="a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life">Now page</dfn>. The last update was on <time>{{ date | dateReadable }}</time>.

 I find myself reading about personal productivity systems and personal information management quite a lot. One of the most useful and inspired articles I've read recently has been [Tiago Forte's article on his *P.A.R.A. Method*](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/). Having my digital files being more meaningfully structured has meant that my desire to work on this website has increased greatly.
