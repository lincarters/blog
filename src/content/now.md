Hey, you're on my <dfn title="a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life">Now page</dfn>. The last update was on <time>{{ date | dateReadable }}</time>.

 I'm reading quite a bit about personal productivity systems and personal information management quite a lot. One of the most useful and inspired articles I've read recently has been [Tiago Forte's article on his *P.A.R.A. Method*](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/). My digital files are now more meaningfully structured. I'm not over-categorising. I'm not trying too hard. It's not much work.
